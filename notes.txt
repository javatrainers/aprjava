String name=123;
// String is data type
// name is a variable
// naming convention of variable is camelcase
// variable name is allowed because it is not a reserved key word
// 123 is value
// name is variable declared as data type String
// this is also a initialization line
// String is data type that allows to store group of character
// however value happens to be numeric
// String is not capable of storing numeric value

RULES on how to use variables


= assignment operator

int a=10;
LHS ( left hand side of equal sign)  int a
RHS ( right hand side of equal sign) 10

LHS should always be a variable
RHS can be a value or another matching variable

1) LHS & RHS data type should match
2) LHS can be variable only
RHS can be value or a variable
	if RHS is a variable.. substitute RHS variable to its value
		
int a=20; // a is 20 in memory
int b=a; // int b=20..... b is 20 in memory
String c="john"; // c is john in memory
a=b; // RHS is variable. substitute value of b on RHS
	// a=20... a is overwritten with same 20 value in memory
b=a; // RHS is variable. substitute value of a on RHS
	// b=20... b is overwritten with same 20 value in memory 
a=30; // a is overwritten with new value 30 in memory
sysout(a); 30
sysout(b); 20
sysout(c); john
	

*********** METHODS
	just like variables store information. 
	METHOD ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR READING/CHANGING INFORMATION
			AND
	PROGRAM COMMUNICATION
************

Exchnage of information

CUSTOMER
	what  is the price of "IPHONE" (input)

SHOP OWNER
	the price is "1000$" (output)

calculate area of recatnagle
public int areaOfReccet( int length, int breadth)
	
input is provided by your customers
output is given back by the program
********* Method Declaration	*********
	
		how to recognize methods : Does-A exercise
		how to code methods :
			What to name this activity ???  login
			how many inputs are required ??? what are the data type of each inputs ???   2 inputs, String userid and String password
			how many outputs are required ??? what is the data type of each output ???   1 output.. boolean
				
		PUBLIC 	OUTPUT 	NAME	(INPUT)
			
		NAME : similar rules as variables
			Follow camelCase format in method names
			Alphabets , numbers, $, _ allowed in method names (cannot start with number)
			area_Of_Rectangle123
	
		OUTPUT : CAN ALWAYS BE 0 or 1 (is mandatory, it has to be just 1.)
			0 = void  ... 
				public  void   hello(String message)
			1 = appropriate data type, int/boolean... 
				public int add(int a, int b)
			more than 1 = complex or multiple infor to return, create a new program. 
				provide data type as the name of the program
				
		INPUT : CAN BE 0 , 1 or MORE  ( is optional )
			0 = if no input require, leave it empty
				public int bye(  )
			1 = if 1 input, write data type and name of the input
				public profile displayProfile(String userid)
			More = if more than 1 input , separated by comma. data type followed by the name
				public boolean login(String userid, string pwd)
******************************************

				public Profile display(String userid)
				
				public class Profile{
					String status,
					String friends, 
					String chats,
					String posts, 
					addr address, 
					long phone
				}


PROGRAM COMMUNICATION HAPPENS THROUGH METHOD CALL
	Caller program - passes input (informatino PASSES from caller to callee)
	Callee program - returns output(informatino PASSES from callee to caller)

Method call = transfers control from caller program to callee program

********* RULES (callee/service provider program) on return statement *********

if the output/return type is primitive or simple
	any variable of same type or any value of same data type can be returned
if the output/return type is complex/object/reference data type
	any variable of same type or null value can be returned.
	
********* RULES (caller/service consumer program) on passing input to method  ********
		
		 	1) number of input should match - 3 input passed
		 	2) data type of input should match - 2 integers and 1 string
		 	3) order of input should match
		public int add(int num1,int num2,String c) 
		
		add(10,20,"john");

********* RULES (caller/service consumer program)  on handling the return type ******

			4) return type of callee program should match LHS variable in the caller program



IS JAVA PASS BY VALUE OR PASS BY REFERENCE
	how method call works ?
	
	ALWAYS PASS BY VALUE



************** Variable Scope *************
Variables = Store/hold information

Person
	(Long term memory)
		Instance variable = Information About you (personal) 
			DNA , fingerprints, name,age, lastname, date of birth
		Class variable = Information About you ( share with thing/speicies like you)
			hobbies,human,breathe
	(Short term memory)
		Parameter variable = Information in the form of Input
		local variable = temp or local information
		
		Input from customer = 10 + 5 + 2 + 4 (parameteric variable)
			10 + 5 = 15(local variable)
			15 + 2 = 17
			17 + 4 = 21



************** operators ****************

statement : declaration, initialization, method call
	
equal sign = assignment operator

	= sign ( assignment operator)
	ALWAYS PROCESS RHS FIRST
	LHS IS ALWAYS A VARIABLE
	RHS can be literal value, variable, method call, expression, new operator etc
	If RHS has a variable... always substitute RHS variable with its latest value
		then further proceed with processing.
	
	*************************POSSIBLE VALUES ON RHS*****************
	int a=10; // RHS literal direct value. Value is stored in a
	
	int b=a; // RHS can be variable. Value of RHS is substitued. that value gets stored in a variable
	// int b=10;
	********* value of a gets stored in LHS variable*******
	
	int c=add(a,25); // method call.. control goes to method add. add method result returned will be then stored in a variable
	// int c=add(10,25); 
	// int c=35;
	***** returned value of method call gets stored in LHS variable ********
	
	int d=a+50; // expression or operator.. solve the expression firt and store result of expression
	//int d=10+50; int d=60;
	***** result of expression gets stored in LHS variable ********
	
	Person p=new Person(); // new operator
	// new = allocate/reserver memory address
	// Person() = construct digital Person in the above allocated address
	// design or blue print on how to construct Person in memory is written in "class Person"
		*****address where Person is created will be stored in LHS variable****
	***********************************************************

int a=30;
int b=15;
add( a, b ); // add(30,15)
int x=20; // int x=20;
int y = x; // int y=20;
int z=x; // int z=20;
y=z; // y=20;
int p=x+y; // int p=20 + 20;
Person per=new Person( x, y );// Person per=new Person(20,20);

1) know what are variables in each line
2) WHEN NOT TO REPLACE VALUES = if variable on LHS



public class calculator{
	public int add(int a, int b){
		int sum=a+b;
		return sum;
	}
}

method = gateway to access/use our software
	1) there is method avaialble = guarantees that customers can use my s/w
	2) HOW will customer use this method ?
		method declaration provides this info
		public int add(int a, int b)
		customer have to provide 2 integer input(numbers)
		customers can expect to recieve result in the form of number



everytime we encounter method call.. the control transfers to method declaration line

************ WHAT IS METHOD DECLARATION AND CALL ******************
Method declaration and method call
method call = input does not have data type mentioned
method declaration = output is mandatory. input
	has data types mentioned

void abc(int a)// method declaration
public int sub(int a, int b) // method declaration
(a,b); // method call
int areaOfSquare(int side) // method declaration
p.areaOfTriangle( 12 );// method call
void hello() // method declaration
bye(); // method call
int result = div(10,20); // method call
int mul(int a, int b); // method declaration
int price=amazon.getProductPrice("iphone"); // method call
public address getRestaurant(string restName) // method declaration

method declaration
	if there is void in line
	if there is data type mentiond in input section
method call	
	if there is equal sign	
	
	
	
************* operators ***************

int a; // declaration statement
a=10; // initialization statement
a=20;// assignment statement

int sum= add(10,20);

RHS = process to a single value

variable = value .... assignment.... RHS value is assigned to LHS variable

value >> variable... (substitue variable with its latest values)
value >>  add(10,20) .... 30 ( call the method.. and store the results returned from the method)
value >>  10+25 .... 35 ( solve the expression and store its result)


== comparison.... LHS is equal to RHS


Is 10 equal to 5 = no / false
is 10 greater than 5 = yes/ true


Logical AND = && : compare userid and password in login page
		registd userid == login userid 
			AND 
		registd pwd = login pwd

TRUE and TRUE = TRUE ( 1 and 1 = 1 )
TRUE and FALSE = FALSE ( 1 and 0 = 0)
FALSE and TRUE = FALSE ( 0 and 1 = 0)
FALSE and FALSE = FALSE ( 0 and 0 = 0)


Logical OR = || : forgot password ...
		registered email = forgot password page entered email
			OR
		registered phone = forgot password page entered phone

TRUE or TRUE = TRUE ( 1 or 1 = 1)
TRUE or FALSE = TRUE ( 1 or 0 = 1 )
FALSE or TRUE = TRUE ( 0 or 1 = 1)
FALSE or FALSE = FALSE ( 0 or 0= 0)

exclusive or
1 ^ 1 = 0
0 ^ 0 = 0
1 ^ 0 = 1
0 ^ 1 = 1


Operators		LHS input			RHS input			Output

Arithmetic		numeric			numeric			numeric  ( 1+2	  : 3)
Equality		object/numeric		object/numeric		boolean  ( 1==2 : false)
Relational		numeric			numeric			boolean  ( 1<2)   : true)
unary 				numeric					numeric  ( 1++ : 2)
conditional	boolean			boolean			boolean   ( true && true : true)
			(equality/relational)  (equality/relational)
bitwise		numeric			numeric			numeric   ( 10 &  5 : 0 )

bit = 1 and 0

int a=10;
int b=20;

conditional or = ||

a == b || b > a

1) 10==20 || 20>10
2) FALSE || TRUE
3) TRUE

Operator precedence (priority)
1) bracket ()
2) * / % 
3) + -
4) relational > <
5) equality ==
6) &&
7) ||
if you have more than 1 operator in same level = process left to right

10+20 *4 / (10-2)

Compiletime polymorphism - Overloaded
	you can resolve conflict without running program.. based upon the input..
	how to implement
		1) method name should be same
		2) input should be different
		3) can have multiple methods with same name in 
			child-parent 
			just child 
			just parent

Runtime polymorphism - Overriding
	you can resolve conflict when running program.. based upon the input datatype respective
		method is called..
