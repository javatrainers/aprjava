internet - network of computers (global) billions
	wireless : satelites inter connected devices such a Phones/mobiles
	wireline : home internet ... copper/fiber cable
	
intranet - closed network , corporate, educational, organization ( 1000 or millions)
LAN - home network

ip - 
	IPv4 = IP version 4
	IPv6 = IP version 6 - 32 digit 
	
cell phone users - every cell phone has unique phone number

Every internet connected devices has unique ID.... IPAddress
	Internet Protocol Address

IP address = to identify a internet connected device
out of billions of devices.
(phone,tablet,pc,laptop, smart watch, smart thermostat, smart refrigeration, smart tv)
IPv4 = ipaddress version 4
x.x.x.x = 256 X 256 X 256  X 256 = 4 billion ip addresses
x= 0-255 = 256 possibilities
12.224.123.78
0.0.0.0
0.0.0.1
0.0.0.2
0.0.0.3
255.255.255.255



8 billion people = 4 billion using internet
	laptop  , cellphone, smart watch, smart tv
	Total devices are connected to the internet =
	4 billion users X number of internet device(atleast 2 device) 
	
every device need to have unique ip address
ip address in total = 4 billion
total internet connect devices = 10 billion

Not enough unique ip address for each of device on internet
	
IPv6 = ipaddress version 6.. trillions and trillions of ip address possibility

32 digit long number
xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx
x=0-9 or A-F ( hexa decimal = 0-9 and first 6 alphabets)

4A9C:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx


WAN IP : ip assigned to device that are directly connected to internet
LAN IP : ip assigned to device that are connected to internet service device such as ROUTER

domain name = alias to ip address just like contact name vs phone number

port/socket 
dns  
dhcp
router - route traffic
load balancer 

n/w commands
	ipconfig - show my lan ip address
	netstat -a - show all ports open
	ping - remote machine is reachable and response time (round trip time)
	telnet - website software is open on remote aws machine
	tracert - find delay in the network (trace route)
