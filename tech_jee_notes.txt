internet - network of computers (global) billions
	wireless : satelites inter connected devices such a Phones/mobiles
	wireline : home internet ... copper/fiber cable
	
intranet - closed network , corporate, educational, organization ( 1000 or millions)
LAN - home network

ip - 
	IPv4 = IP version 4
	IPv6 = IP version 6 - 32 digit 
	
cell phone users - every cell phone has unique phone number

Every internet connected devices has unique ID.... IPAddress
	Internet Protocol Address

IP address = to identify a internet connected device
out of billions of devices.
(phone,tablet,pc,laptop, smart watch, smart thermostat, smart refrigeration, smart tv)
IPv4 = ipaddress version 4
x.x.x.x = 256 X 256 X 256  X 256 = 4 billion ip addresses
x= 0-255 = 256 possibilities
12.224.123.78
0.0.0.0
0.0.0.1
0.0.0.2
0.0.0.3
255.255.255.255 



8 billion people = 4 billion using internet
	laptop  , cellphone, smart watch, smart tv
	Total devices are connected to the internet =
	4 billion users X number of internet device(atleast 2 device) 
	
every device need to have unique ip address
ip address in total = 4 billion
total internet connect devices = 10 billion

Not enough unique ip address for each of device on internet
	
IPv6 = ipaddress version 6.. trillions and trillions of ip address possibility

32 digit long number
xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx
x=0-9 or A-F ( hexa decimal = 0-9 and first 6 alphabets)

4A9C:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx


WAN IP : ip assigned to device that are directly connected to internet
LAN IP : ip assigned to device that are connected to internet service device such as ROUTER

domain name = alias to ip address just like contact name vs phone number

port/socket 
dns  
dhcp
router - route traffic
load balancer 

n/w commands
	ipconfig - show my lan ip address
		display hosts ip address
	netstat -a - show all ports open
		network statistic - host ip/port >>>>> server ip/port
					
	ping - remote machine is reachable and response time (round trip time)
		
	telnet - website software is open on remote aws machine
	tracert - find delay in the network (trace route)






***********************

Website project
	1) How do you write program that can be hosted on internet... additional library/program to be included in project
		project depedancy - Spring web
	2) Project structure - java stored in src/java folder... web/html program in src/main/resource/webapps
	3) Web Server software - Apache Tomcat 
	4) (BUILD) Package your website s/w - single exe/setup file ( archived/compressed
		all your programs)
		Spring-boot : Type-Maven... packaging - WAR
		
		
		
Spring Boot 
	Project Eco System - Helps with all the above



jar - group of java programs ( Java ARchive)
	single setup/executable file that consists of java 
war - group of web pgrams (Web ARchive)
	single setup/executable file that consists of java/html/images/video

Chrome browser s/w
	chrome browser s/w : written with 100s or 1000s of programs
	install chrome browser : installation... where ALL programs that make
		up your software are PACKAGED in a single setup/exe file
		setup/install file : package/compressed/archive file that contains
			100s/1000s of your programs

setup Spring boot project in your laptop..
when u launch Spring boot project in your laptop...
	website accessible to you only : by entering localhost in your laptop browser
	
Deploying : 
	1) package your code in setup/exe file
	2) upload your exe file onto Cloud (AWS, Mic Azure, Google cloud)
	3) install  your exe file in Cloud (AWS, Mic Azure, Google cloud)
	4) launch your website from cloud
	
	free tier = trial account
	
	
Programming /devlopment : on your laptop
local website testing on your machine (local/developent setup = website is accessible to you)
	start website locally on spring tool suite s/w = right click on xxxApplicatino.java > run as > java application
	Use browser to test your website
	http://localhost
	validate your changes 
Build
	New changes on website program has to be re-packaged into
	new setup file
	pom.xml > right click > maven install
	generate new setup file
	Project location > target folder > xxxxx.war
production Deployment (production = website is accessible to the public)
	upload xxxx.war file onto AWS machine (Winscp or Terminal)
	remote login into aws machine (putty)
		start your website = java command on setup/exe file  xxxx.war
		WEBSITE IS LIVE FOR EVERYONE ( with changes that u did to the website)

website is down for maintainance
please try again later


Local setup = your laptop
pre-production setup
production setup = aws machine leasing/renting from cloud

Athlete prepare
	baseball athelete
		net practice = small setup for practice
		game practce = bigger ground ... practice among your team member
		competiion = same sized ground as game practice... 


Build
deployment
production release
dev testing


sudo nohup java -jar asdsad.war &

sudo  - super user 
	login ec2-user .. not  a admin user... sudo admin privileges
nohup - nohangup 
	java program will be running in background
java -jar ... java command substitute ( click of run button on sprint tool suite)
& - console output is basicually redirected to a flaat file
	nohup.out
	
***************** XML *********************


xml - data format
extensible markup language - meta data (information about data)
UTF - 8 = write data in ascii character
UTF - 16
dtd = document type definition
xsd = xml schema design
	type of each eleemnt = city element stores text value, zip element store numberedd value
	validation = customer element can have more than 1 address element, building name is optional
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE MyDocs SYSTEM "filename.dtd">
<customer>

</customer>
element : nested (element within an element)
	represented with anchor tags. every opened element has to be closed ( STRICTLY TYPED LANGUAGE )
	<>=opening tag/element
	</>=closing tag
	root element = first element in xml file.. customer.. there can be only 1 root element
	parent element = address is parent of building
	child element = building is child of parent
	sibling element = building and city. city and state etc
	elements = represent complex value.. information that can be further divided..
	value = non-element text information.. between opening and closing tag
attributes : information might be atomic... indivisible....
	key-value pair.. and are associated with an element
	building number = 12334
	
	
**************** HTML *****************

web content resource - webpage, image, video
Hyper-Text : links to other web content resoures text
HTML : Hyper-Text Markup language
HTTP : Hyper-text Transfer protocol (Fedex,USPS)
Browser : Http Client... Understands Html , converts
	HTML program into Graphical Display
	
	
	HTML : TEXT and INPUT section of webpage
CSS :Cascading Style Sheet 
	dimension, color,size, position, 
	animation
JavaScript : validation, animation
	

Event listeners : when customer interacts..
	Customer interact with website... Mouse or Keyboard
	
	
	
Frontend
	html : webpage input elements , images, video
	css : styling of webpage includes dimensions, colors, alignment, animation
	javascript 
Backend
	java
	
	
java : variable and methods and control flows ( if , while, for )
	variable : simple/primitive, and object/complex
		String name; int age; String city; float height;
		public class student{
			String school="java school";
			int grade=12;
			String name="john";
			public void sayHello(){
			}
		}
		Student s=new Student();
		s.grade
		s.sayHello();
		
javascript : variable and functions
		var name="john"; 
		name=20;
		
		var age=10; 
		var height=12.1;
		var active=true;
		var s={
			school:"javascript school",
			grade:2,
			name:"john"
		};
		console.log( s.grade );

Java method :

int result=add( 10 , 20);
public int add(int a, int b ){
	int sum=a+b;
	return sum;
}

javascript function :
var result=add(10,20);
function add( a , b ){
	var sum=a+b;
	return sum;
}



Event listeners : track customer activity,
	Mouse : movement, click
	
	Keyboard : typing

	HTML : focus, blur, load, unload
	
HTML / CSS / Javascipt / Java	
Html element :
	id = javascript uses this attribute to access customer input
	class = css uses this provide styling , animation, color, dimensions
	name = java (server side program) uses this attribute to access customer input
	
	
TRANSFER CONTROL FROM HTML TO JS : EVENT LISTENERES
DATA GETS ACCESSED FROM JS TO HTML : ID ATTRIBUTE



*********** JQuery ****************

javascript framework

1) simple coding
2) animation
3) decoupled architecutre

<div id="one">
	<div id="two">
	</div>
</div>

<div id="three">hi john</div>

$("#two").parent

html content inside an element = 
	$("#one").html()  >>>> <div id="two"></div>
text content in an element
	$("#three").text()  >>>>>> hi john
customer typed input from the webpage
	$("#userid").val()

above methods are overloaded... 
$("#userid").val()		= READ what customer typed in userid text box
$("#userid").val("please type userid") = WRITE text in userid text box



name = java
id	= javascript
class = CSS


browser/html program
	on click of a button
	
	website name = ? http://localhost/
	action attribute value = ? login 
	what are the name attributes in html form = ? userid , password
	what are the input in each of html elements = ? mike , mike123
	
	constructed upon a click of a button
	http://localhost/login?userid=mike&password=mike123
	
	http://localhost : address of website server machine (domain name)
	/login		: connected to a SPECIFIC java program on that website server machine (there can be more than 1 java program)
	?			: query string 
	userid=mike&password=mike123 :
		& acts like infor separator
		key=value pair allows us to identify information
	
	userid=jane&password=jane123
	qweqwe & dfgdfgdg & qeqweqwe
